            <li>Model name:<b>Iphone 11</b></li>
            <li>Price : <b>Unaffordable</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>As part of our efforts to reach carbon neutrality by 2030, iPhone 11 does not include a power adapter or EarPods. Included in the box is a USB‑C to Lightning cable that supports fast charging and is compatible with USB‑C power adapters and computer ports.

            We encourage you to re‑use your current USB‑A to Lightning cables, power adapters and headphones that are compatible with these iPhone models. But if you need any new Apple power adapters or headphones, they are available for purchase.</p>
